## Instructions and recommendetions 

* Clone the exam form terminal using  `git clone`.

* Answer each question following the instructions in the jupyter notebook. The order is irrelevant.  
* You may ask questions if needed. Part of the evaluation consists on seeing how you handle problems. 
* You can test your solution with not-so-good code practices. Following the best-practices is encorage. 
* Use of apply, lambda functions, maps (or list comprehension) over for / while loops is prefered. 
* After completing the test, change the name of the jupyter to 'FirstAttempt_MyName' replacing your name in 'MyName' (as 'MartinOdersky').
* Download your answers as an HTML file and send the .ipynb and .html to rhernandez@crabi.com with the headline '[Data Science Test] MyName'. 



Happy coding! May the knowdlege be with you!
